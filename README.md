# LargestSumSubarray

A java program to find the contiguous subarray within a one dimensional array of numbers (containing at least one positive number) which has the largest sum. If there are multiple subarrays with largest sum, one with the smallest length will be printed.
For example, for the sequence of values −2, 1, −3, 4, −1, 2, 1, −5, 4; the contiguous subarray with the
largest sum is 4, −1, 2, 1, with sum 6.


  
**Input**

Enter the array : **-2** **1** **-3** **4** **-1** **2** **1** **-5** **4**

**Output**

Start Index: 3

Length: 4

Sum: 6

Elements: 4 -1 2 1
